# Friend Service

In life, bad heroes always win.

The positive hero has a code of honor through which he simply does not want to step over so as not to upset his own balance of respect for himself.

In this service, I would like to break this rule and enable the goodies to defeat evil. Therefore, in my understanding, the positive hero must be active and must hit first, and then it does not matter what the negative hero is up to.

The main idea is to prevent evil from acting first.

In this case, a secret "friends" unit was infiltrated into the heroes to defeat the "Avengers" unit.

P.S. Yes I know that the winner will become evil, but that is another question.
